# A collection of coding creations By David Mikkelson

***

I like to create solutions to all sorts of challenges with my ever growing computer skills.  I am always trying to improve my skills in any language that seems useful.  I finished a coding boot camp [Tech Academy](https://learncodinganywhere.com) and I am still learning at [Team Treehouse](https://teamtreehouse.com/davidmikkelson).

This repository contains my solutions to programming challenges that I solved.

### Python




### php

* php is harder to show but I've made a website using it: (we are not lost)[http://www.wearenotlost.org]
